# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detection

A machine learning project that classifies emails as Spam or Ham using three different models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a TensorFlow neural network. The project is based on an open-source dataset of labeled email messages.

## ðŸ§  Models Used
- Random Forest Classifier

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- TensorFlow Neural Network


### Model	Accuracy
Random Forest -	98%
SVM	- 96%
TensorFlow -	100%*


### Libraries
- Python

- Scikit-learn

- TensorFlow / Keras

- Numpy & Pandas

### ðŸ—‚ Dataset
This project uses an open-source email spam dataset containing labeled messages. Preprocessing steps included:

Lowercasing and tokenization

Removing punctuation and stop words

TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction

### ðŸ“Œ Key Features
Trained and evaluated using multiple models

Text preprocessing using NLTK and Scikit-learn pipelines

Clear comparison between traditional ML and neural networks

Confusion matrix and accuracy-based evaluatio
